Flexible-Neural-Network
=======================

In progress... A Neural Network written in Octave that will allow you to parameterise the number and size of hidden layers and the number of output classes.

Work is still outstanding on parameterisation, validating the calculations and on measuring accuracy against a test set. Also consider automatic tuning of regularisation parameter again a cross validation set.
